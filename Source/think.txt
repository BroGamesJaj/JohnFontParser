loop contours
    get the last point of contour
    find first point of contour

    loop points between first and last point
        get 2 points next to each other (last and first is also needed)
        if 2 points are same onCurve
            put implied point

    add insert count to end point of contour


get 2 points:
    p1 = i
    p2 = ( i + 1 > last point ? i+1 % (last point + 1) + first point : i + 1)

put implied point:
    calc imp
    push every point after p1 to right by 1
    put imp after p1 
    increment inserts
    increment number of points
